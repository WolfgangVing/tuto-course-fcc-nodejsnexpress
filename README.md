This is not a project of my own, neither is it for real use, this is just my code throughout the course Node.js and Express.Js - Full Course from [FCC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe421EPjeBE&t=7564s) on YouTube.
I probably shouldn't use GitHub like this, but I had a glimpse that I would improve at two fields while learning Node.js since I have been refraining from using GitHub, I keep thinking that I'm still not good enough and programming. So I decided that if want to get out of that state I would have to start from somewhere, anywhere, anything, with that in mind. So I will start by using Git and GitHub through this course, aiming for learning Git, GitHub, Node.Js, Express.js.
This won't end here though, FCC also has a course with actual projects that I can use for my portfolio, so at the end of this, I will start those projects.
